# SonyAlbumA13Port
by request updated the Sony Album app to support A13 and newer. 

Note: I'll leave the app as is, I won't do any fixes. Feel free to download the APK and fix the bugs mentioned in "issues", they are relatively easy to fix. 

The Xperia community is full of fanboys that state the xperia is perfect and anything is bloat that isn't stock android. 
I know people visiting this repo are not fanboys and infact do want the old Xperia features and apps back while also know about real issues the xperia line has, however people keep quiet and let the fanboys run rampant, this discourages developers such as myself to contribute anything. Remember, even if you keep quiet it's a choice, as in, you're letting the majority, which are the fanboys, talk for you. 

This leads to a dead development community, stagnanted Sony development inhouse since "there are no problems" and you have to live with a subpar overpriced experience because you let other people talk for you. Let that be food for thought, peace out.
